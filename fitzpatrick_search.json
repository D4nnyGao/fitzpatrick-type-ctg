The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nWill performing up to 6 months of treatment sessions with alexandrite laser will result in tolerable local skin reactions and reduction in both individual cNF size by \\>50% as well as improved cNF appearance in the treated field? If there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare laser treatment with cooling to both laser treatment without cooling and an untreated control see if laser treatments are effective and if cooling makes treatment more tolerable.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Receive up to 6 monthly laser treatments.\n* Complete surveys asking about pain during and after treatments.\n* Complete surveys asking about satisfaction with the treatments.\n* Undergo 2D photography and 3D imaging of treatment areas.\n* Optionally, receive biopsies of up to 6 treated lesions to investigate characteristics of tumors that respond well to treatment as well as non-respondent tumors."

          "detailedDescription": "This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the efficacy and safety of Artefill for correction of moderate to severe atrophic acne scars.\n\nThe study is divided into two study periods. In Period I, scars meeting the treatment criteria will be individually identified, numbered and mapped using photographs and transparent sheets prior to treatment. This mapping will be used to track individual scars throughout the trial. Four (4) weeks following a baseline qualification visit, subjects randomized to treatment will receive one treatment of Artefill or Control (saline), administered by the Treating Investigator. At 72 hours following injections, subjects will be followed-up by telephone to confirm the occurrence of any AEs. Subjects will return to the clinic at 2 weeks for follow-up evaluation, and then at 4 weeks where subjects may receive one optional touch-up treatment. Subjects receiving touch-up treatment will be followed-up by telephone at 72 hours to confirm the occurrence of any AEs, and return for clinic visits at 6 weeks and 8 weeks. All subjects will then return for clinic follow-up at months 3 and 6 (after last treatment).\n\nPeriod II is open label and will begin at month 6. Artefill group subjects will return to the clinic for assessments at months 9 and 12 (Track A) and Control group subjects will enter Track B, re-establish baseline, and complete additional month 6 visit activities including Artefill treatment. Subjects will receive touch up (if required) 4 weeks later, and be followed for an additional 12 months.\n\nSubjects will be required to abstain from other aesthetic treatment to their face during the study period and failure to do so will be considered a protocol violation. However, if a subject does receive additional aesthetic or non-aesthetic treatments, available information on such treatment will be collected and the subject will be continued to be followed per protocol. Such subjects will not be excluded from the analysis, but will also be evaluated separately."

An easy and inexpensive way to determine which subjects would benefit from supplementation with carotenoids or retinoids could be the measurement of skin carotenoid levels.The least invasive way to perform it is through Raman spectroscopy which is a technique that uses a laser light that can be used to quantify carotenoids on the skin. We will compare the skin carotenoid levels of subjects with previous history of SCC or BCC and subjects without history of previous NMSC."

The study includes skin biopsies to evaluate the effects of NanoDOX® Doxycycline Monohydrate Gel on wound healing after the ablative laser procedure. Study subjects will be asked to do 2 visits of 4 hours in total over approximately 1 week. An optional third visit will take place approximately 6 weeks after Visit 1. In this study, 20 subjects are expected to enroll with a goal of 12 healthy subjects to enroll and complete the study.",
          "detailedDescription": "Effective topical delivery of any pharmaceutical agent requires small molecule drugs to penetrate the epidermis, yet the absorption of topical products through the epidermis is limited.\n\nIn this study, the investigators are looking for healthy volunteers who are eligible to help us to determine the safety and efficacy of ablative fractional laser therapy combined with NanoDOX. The investigators are doing the research to evaluate drug delivery of topical NanoDOX® Hydrogel following ablative fractional CO2 laser treatment and our secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of NanoDOX® for wound healing.\n\nSubjects will have a screening visit to determine eligibility, 2 study visits when they will receive CO2 ablative fractional laser treatment, NanoDOX® Hydrogel application, and skin biopsies, and 1 optional study visit for wound healing assessment. Laser procedure will happen only during visit 1, visit 2 will happen 2 days after visit 1, and visit 3 will happen approximately 6 weeks after visit 1. In total, 7 skin biopsies will be performed."

          "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this randomized, split-face, controlled study is to compare the efficacy and safety of a erbium-doped 1,550-nm non-ablative fractional laser and a bipolar fractional radiofrequency microneedle device for the treatment of atrophic facial acne scars in ethnic skin (Fitzpatrick Skin Phototypes III-VI).\n\nThe hypothesis of this study is that both erbium-doped 1,550-nm non-ablative fractional laser and the bipolar fractional radiofrequency microneedle device are equally effective for the treatment of atrophic acne scars in ethnic skin (SPT III-VI). However, the bipolar fractional radiofrequency microneedle device has less adverse effects than erbium-doped 1,550-nm non-ablative fractional laser due to the absence of scattering and the absence of chromophore-specific targets - predominantly melanin - traditionally needed with laser treatments; hence the fractional radiofrequency microneedle device will have a higher safety profile in darker skin types .",
          "detailedDescription": "Acne is a highly prevalent disease and post-acne scaring has shown to have detrimental effects on a person's physical, mental, and social well-being. Acne scars can be divided in general categories of hypertrophic or keloid scars, atrophic scars (icepick, rolling, boxcar), and pigmentation alterations (redness, hypo and hyper-pigmentation). This study will focus on treatment of moderate to severe grades of atrophic acne scarring. Our aim is to compare the efficacy and safety of a erbium-doped 1,550-nm non-ablative fractional laser and a bipolar fractional radiofrequency microneedle device for the treatment of atrophic acne scars in ethnic skin (Fitzpatrick Skin Phototypes III-VI) by performing a split-face randomized controlled trial.\n\nBoth devices in this study are already FDA approved treatment modalities for acne scarring.\n\nHistory of erbium-doped 1,550-nm non-ablative fractional laser (Fraxel® Restore Laser System, Solta Medical, Inc., Hayward, CA):\n\nNon-ablative fractional lasers work via the theory of fractional photothermolysis, which creates hundreds to thousands of microscopic thermal zones (MTZs), or columns of thermally injured skin, while sparing the surrounding tissue. The pixilated nature of treatment and the functionally unimpaired stratum corneum allow for rapid tissue healing and allows for safer treatments of our patients. Mechanistically, fractional photothermolysis allows controlled amounts of high energy to be delivered deep within the dermis resulting in collagenolysis and neocollagenesis, which smoothes the textural abnormalities of acne scarring.\n\nMultiple published studies have demonstrated that erbium-doped 1,550-nm non-ablative fractional laser (\"NAFL\") can be successfully utilized in the treatment of all forms of atrophic acne scarring - ice-pick, boxcar, and rolling scars - with a very favorable safety profile in all skin types, and thus, has been cleared by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that particular indication. According to the manufacture manual (reference attached in the \"Attachments\" section), NAFL is indicated for \"use in skin resurfacing procedures as well as treatment of acne scars, surgical scars, lentigos (age spots), solar lentigos (sun spots), actinic keratosis, and melasma.\"\n\nHistory of the fractional radiofrequency microneedle device (Fractora; Invasix Ltd./InMode MD Ltd., Israel):\n\nFractional radiofrequency is not a laser. Instead, these devices use an array of electrodes that allows for zones of thermal wounds to be created between areas of unaffected zones, thus stimulating dermal remodeling and allowing for a supply of reservoir cells to promote healing. Variations of fractional radiofrequency exist that employ microneedles to deliver electrical current to a particular depth within the dermis that decreases damage to the epidermis. These fractional radiofrequency microneedle devices provide an alternative to conventional methods of acne-scar treatment (such as NAFL). Great interest has been culminating over the recent years for the use of such devices in acne scars due to the absence of light scattering and the absence of chromophore-specific targets traditionally needed with laser treatments. As melanin is not a target, it is felt to have a higher safety profile in darker skin phototypes.\n\nA recent study investigated the safety and efficacy of a specific bipolar fractional radiofrequency microneedle device (Fractora; Invasix Ltd./InMode MD Ltd., Israel) for acne and acne scarring. In this study, 8 patients with acne scars were reported and it was noted that all patients (regardless of their skin phototypes) had improvement in their active acne and acne scars after 4 treatments and a 1 month, on average follow-up period. The treatment was well tolerated without any side-effects. Skin biopsies from this study showed reduction in scar depth and new collagen formation with an increase in elastic fibers and adnexal structures noted. A follow-up report showed that 4 out of 8 patients who were in the original study returned for a long term follow-up from 1 to 2 years, that showed ongoing clinical improvements in these patients. This specific bipolar fractional radiofrequency microneedle (\"FRM\") device has been FDA-approved for acne scars and skin rejuvenation.\n\nTo this date the efficacy and safety of 1,550-nm fractionated photothermolysis system has not been compared to a fractional radiofrequency microneedle device for atrophic acne scars in ethnic skin in a randomized split-face controlled trial. A major advantage of a split-face self-controlled design would be to minimize any confounding factors. Laser resurfacing has been well studied and is widely used in individuals with fair skin - Fitzpatrick skin phototypes (SPT) I to II. However, there is a paucity of published studies involving individuals with darker skin types (SPT III-VI)-a population that has a higher risk of laser-associated dyspigmentation."

          "briefSummary": "Radiotherapy, an essential modality in cancer treatment, frequently induces a fibrotic process in the skin which can lead to increased risk of malignancy, poor wound healing, pain and limitation of movement, and permanent loss of skin appendages with hyper/hypopigmentation, decreased sweating and xerosis, posing significant cosmetic and quality of life issues. Advances in laser therapy has led to the use of fractional laser treatment (FLT) to treat fibrosis associated with in hypertrophic scars and morphea, leading to tissue repair, scar remodeling. The investigators propose a pilot clinical study to test the hypothesis that FLT can normalize the fibrotic process and induce normal scar remodeling in patients affected by chronic radiation injury. Understanding and correcting this underlying fibrotic process can help restore normal skin functions in patients affected with chronic radiation dermatitis (RD) and other debilitating fibrotic diseases in dermatology such as scleroderma, morphea, or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.",
          "detailedDescription": "We propose to treat 22 patients with significant radiation induced fibrosis (RIF) and skin changes. Each patient will receive fractional treatment (FLT) using the Lumenis Ultrapulse Carbon Dioxide (CO2) laser as well as control (no treatment) randomized to site. Patient age, type of cancer, method/dosage of radiation, latency between radiation treatment and start of study, and characteristics of skin changes will be recorded, including fibrosis surface area, depth, color, and compliance. Assessments will be conducted before each treatment, after each treatment, and 3-12 months after the last treatment."

          "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to find out if a non-invasive imaging device called Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) can help doctors to see the tissue and blood vessels that are related to non-melanoma skin cancers. OFDI was designed to see microscopic details of your skin without needing to use any invasive techniques such as surgery or biopsy.",
          "detailedDescription": "Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common cancer in the United States, with more than 750,000 diagnosed patients treated every year. Its prevalence and incidence have significantly increased over the past two decades and it has been estimated that 20% of all Americans will develop this type of cancer during their lifetime (Neville et al., 2007). Biopsy and surgical resection of NMSC can result in tissue mutilation and scaring. Therefore, there is a need for new imaging technologies that can be used to non-invasively guide biopsy and surgery.\n\nOptical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) is a second-generation imaging implementation of optical coherence tomography (OCT) developed at the Wellman Center. OFDI provides high-resolution three-dimensional imaging in tissue. It uses an interferometric depth-sectioning technique and employs a near-infrared light source. Through analysis of phase information in the recorded signal. OFDI can detect blood vessels within tissues and tumors. Importantly, OFDI-based vascular imaging can be performed without the need for exogenous contrast agents, making it relatively easy to deploy in clinical settings."

The 10 questions cover topics: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment over the previous week. Response categories include \"not at all,\" \"a little,\" \"a lot,\" and \"very much,\" with corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Questions 3-10 have an additional response category of \"not relevant,\" which is scored as \"0.\" Questions are scored from 0 to 3. Total score ranges from 0 (no impact) to 30 (maximum impact), with higher scores indicating poorer quality of life.\n\nResults for Week 24 data will be presented at the time of reporting the final results.",

Eligible subjects will receive 3 bi-weekly treatments (2 weeks interval) with the UltraShape Power device utilizing the U-Sculpt Power Transducer according to the study protocol. Subjects will return for 3 follow-up visits: four weeks (4wk FU), eight weeks (8wk FU) and 12 weeks (12wk FU) after the last treatment (Third Treatment).\n\nEach subject will be enrolled for total expected study duration of 16 weeks. Subject's abdominal fat thickness and circumference will be measured at the measurements points and will be assessed at each visit. Additionally, a subject questionnaire will be completed in each follow-up visit (4wk, 8wk and 12wk FU). Finally, photography will be performed under visible light conditions of the front, right, left and back view. Most of the assessments will occur at each of the visits (all treatments and all follow-up visits) to the clinic."

          "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this trial is to collect data from the use of VELOS in clinical practice under a wide range of treatment parameters variability including RF energy, laser fluence, and laser pulse duration for treating each of the vascular disorders. This will be conducted by documenting the physician selected treatment parameters, as well as the subjects' clinical clearing response, perception of improvement and sensations, through the study treatments and post-treatment(s) follow-up visits.\n\nOptional exploratory objectives: Collection of safety and efficacy data of the Velos with DCD cooling and Velos with contact cooling. The investigator may opt to include in this study noninvasive measurements of erythema, melanin and texture (which may be performed by eg. Chromameter, Mexameter or 3D imaging), and measurements of linear vessel diameters and lesion size."

Primary aim of the study is to assess the impact of the video intervention on sun protection intentions and behavior in young adult cancer survivors compared to a control intervention. Secondary aims are to describe the impact of the appearance information when included in the SunSmart intervention, to investigate the extent to which the intervention changes sun protection through hypothesized mediating variables, and to describe the consistency of sleep behaviors over time in cancer survivors."

          "briefSummary": "Acne scarring is an unfortunate consequence of inflammatory acne vulgaris that often leads to significant cosmetic and psychosocial impacts. Although there have been many advances in the treatment of acne scarring, it remains one of the greatest challenges in cosmetic and laser dermatology.\n\nThere have been a multitude of studies establishing the efficacy of non-ablative fractional laser therapy for the treatment of atrophic acne scars, and it is widely regarded as one of the best available treatments. More recently, there has been a renewed interest in controlled, non-thermal dermal injury via microneedling devices in the treatment of atrophic acne scars.\n\nWhere there is a gap in the literature, however, is in the evaluation of the combination of non-ablative fractional laser resurfacing with microneedling in the treatment of atrophic acne scars.\n\nThe investigators' study will compare the safety and efficacy of using non-ablative fractional laser versus a combination of microneedling and non-ablative fractional laser for atrophic acne scars using a randomized, double-blind, split-face study.\n\nThe investigators' aim is to further elucidate the pathogenesis of acne scarring and the best approaches for treatment. In doing so, the investigators will study a combination approach to this complex problem in order to better serve future patients.",
          "detailedDescription": "Acne vulgaris is a highly prevalent dermatologic disorder that affects up to 90% percent of the population at some point in their lives to varying degrees. Acne scarring is an unfortunate complication of the inflammation that results if acne is not sufficiently treated. Classically, acne scarring has been described as either atrophic, hypertrophic, keloidal, or pigmented. Atrophic is by far the most common type of acne scarring and is subdivided into boxcar, rolling, and icepick subtypes. The presence of acne scarring has been associated with a significant decrease in patient well-being and has many psychosocial implications. Although the understanding of the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of acne scarring has come a long way, there are limitations to the current treatment options and the search for a cure continues.\n\nOne of the greatest advances in the treatment of acne scarring came with the advent of non-ablative fractional lasers, which work through the theory of fractional photothermolysis. Fractional photothermolysis relies on the principle of creating thousands of microthermal injury zones in the skin while allowing the surrounding intact skin to expedite wound healing. The relative sparing of the epidermis while facilitating collagen remodeling in the dermis underlies the use of non-ablative fractional laser therapy in the treatment of atrophic scars.\n\nThe erbium-doped 1,550-nm non-ablative fractional laser has been extensively studied in the treatment of atrophic acne scars with good efficacy and safety.\n\nThe concept of using needle subcision for the treatment of depressed surgical scars was first described by Orentreich et al in 1995. The first microneedling device, a drum-shaped roller was subsequently developed by Fernandes et al in the early 2000s. Several studies have validated the use of microneedling for acne scarring with a similar mechanism of creating microchannels in the dermis that allow for collagen remodeling. Furthermore, microneedling has been demonstrated to induce a specific cytokine profile including fibroblast-like growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta3 which are associated with favorable wound healing.\n\nMore recently, experts have advocated for the use of electric-powered microneedling devices which allow for more controlled injury at a set depth, density, and speed for the treatment of atrophic acne scars with good results.\n\nTo the investigators' knowledge, this study will be the first of its kind to compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of 1,550-nm erbium-doped fractional laser and microneedling with the SkinPenTM device to 1,550-nm erbium-doped fractional laser alone in the treatment of atrophic acne scars.\n\nBoth treatment modalities in this study are already FDA approved treatment modalities for acne scarring."

Subjects are blinded to needle gauge and density.\n\nThere will be two cohorts of subjects: one group of subjects will receive a single treatment and the second - multiple treatments. All subjects will be followed for 180 days with several intermediate visits at 3, 7, 30, 60, and 90-days."

          "briefSummary": "Atrophic acne scars are a common and important sequelae of acne that affect up to 43-55% of patients with acne. Scarring impacts quality of life with reports of diminished self-esteem and frustration/sadness; additionally, some individuals report that their appearance even interferes with their professional lives. Though many treatments for acne scarring exist including ablative and nonablative lasers, subcision, and peels, none is without risk of adverse effects of pain, post-procedure redness or pigmentary changes. There have been no randomized studies directly comparing the effectiveness and safety profiles of microneedling (Dermapen) to 1,540nm nonablative fractional lasers (Palomar StarLux) in the treatment of atrophic acne scarring in skin of color. This clinical trial aims to determine which treatment modality -- microneedling or nonablative fractional laser -- is safer and more efficacious in the treatment of acne scarring in patients with skin of color."

In contrast, multiple pulses induce summation of irreversible, thermal injury from a series of lower-peak temperature heating cycles and may therefore reduce mechanical injury while preserving the selectivity of photothermal injury. Ideally, hemorrhage could be prevented and the efficiency of vessel closure could be greater. A clinical and histological pilot study of 10 adults with either facial or non-facial PWS is therefore proposed here."

          "detailedDescription": "Patient compliance with laboratory testing is one of the most underrecognized challenges in developing a treatment plan for acute and chronically ill patients. The ability to offer alternatives to standard venipuncture blood draws would greatly increase a laboratory's ability to provide testing to patients and health care providers.The fingerstick blood draw has been used as an alternative.\n\nAiming a less painful, potentially easier alternative we devised a novel that can be applied distally on the digit prior to the blood collection procedure and may provide analgesia through a liquid coolant that is run through tubes in the device to safely cool tissue to achieve numbing. We hypothesize that this device will safely and effectively reduce the pain associated with the fingertip pricks and increase the amount of capillary blood collected.\n\nMultiple punctures with a large lancet were a frequent cause of discomfort among patients.With this new device the discomfort will be reduced by its application followed by the numbness of the finger.\n\nThe investigators plan to have 12 patients to complete the study. Subjects must be equal to greater than 18 years old and younger than 60 years older and may be any gender or Fitzpatrick skin type."

Additionally, the investigators aim to test the effects of a common lip augmentation procedure, hyaluronic-acid based fillers, on the appearance (volume, texture and color) of aging lips, in addition to the tolerability of this procedure. It is hypothesized that dermal lip fillers may decrease the redness of the lips.\n\nBesides, the investigators want to evaluate oxytocin level changes and relate it to subjects' satisfaction after the lip filler procedure."

Test spot exposures will take place prior to abdominoplasty resections at the following possible time points (by group):\n\n* Group A (up to n=5): Genius exposure 1-3 hours before tissue resection\n* Group B (up to n=5): Genius exposure 30+7 days, 14+3 days, and 7+3 days before tissue resection. All test spot exposure visits will have a follow-up visit at 7+3 days after the test spot exposure visit.\n* Group C (up to n=5): Genius exposure 90+14 days, 60+10 days, and 30+7 days before tissue resection. All test spot exposure visits will have a follow-up visit at 7+3 days after the test spot exposure visit.\n* Group D (up to n=10): Genius, LaseMD, LaseMD FLEX, eCO2 and/or PicoPlus exposure 14+3 days, 7+3 days, and 1-3 hours before tissue resection. All test spot exposure visits will have a follow-up visit at 7+3 days after the test spot exposure visit.\n\nSubjects receive test spot exposures at sites on the abdomen that will be resected during abdominoplasty. The area of the test spots will be approximately 2 x 2 cm2 but may be appropriately adjusted for fit within the resected tissue area. Subject pain during exposure will be monitored and recorded using a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale.\n\nActivities related to the abdominoplasty procedure are considered outside the scope of this study and will not be recorded or reported on during this study. The subject will be exited from the study prior to abdominoplasty procedures after all study related procedures with the exception of tissue preparation of excised tissue are complete. Tissue preparation of excised tissue will be completed after the subject has been exited from the study."

Measuring skin oxygen consumption has traditionally been difficult as the tools available have not been easy to incorporate into clinical studies. In this study, we overcome this barrier through the use of a new non-invasive oxygen-sensing device that can rapidly measure skin oxygenation properties such as oxygen consumption. This observational study will measure the oxygenation properties of both chronically sun exposed and less sun exposed skin in the predefined groups of both young and older men and women."

A 30% reduction of sebum production in a treated site compared to baseline Sebutape measurements will be considered clinically meaningful. Sebutape is an adhesive patch that acts as a passive collector of sebum. The gradual displacement of air in the pores of the microporous film changes its appearance. The size of the transparent area is a measure of the amount of sebum collected. All Sebutape measurements were performed in duplicate and the average of the two measurements was used for analysis. Results indicate the mean difference in Sebutape scores from baseline to 2 weeks post-treatment.",
