# Clinical Trial Data Pipeline

## File Descriptions

- **`clinical_trial_pipeline.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook that runs the entire pipeline, from fetching API data to creating the final, clean dataset.
- **`combined_search.json`**: Stores the raw, unprocessed data downloaded directly from the ClinicalTrials.gov API search query.
- **`final_fitzpatrick_trials_dataset.csv`**: The final, cleaned, and analysis-ready dataset produced by the notebook, with one row per clinical trial.
